# TASKS

## Task 1 - Predicting Using Supervised Machine Learning

  In this task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
    This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.
   ### Focusing Question:
   
   1. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?
