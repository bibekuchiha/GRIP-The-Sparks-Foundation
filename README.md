## About The Sparks Foundation

![](logo_small.png)

[The Sparks Foundation](https://thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/) mission is to inspire students, help them innovate, and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind. To inspire, motivate, and encourage students to learn, create, and help build a better society. To teach new ways of thinking, to innovate and solve the problems on their own. We help the students to integrate and help each other, learn from each other, and do well together.

Their Vision Statement : A world of enabled and connected little minds, building future. Our Mission Statement To inspire students, help them innovate and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind.

# TASKS

## Task 1 - Predicting Using Supervised ML

  In this task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
    This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.
   ### Focusing Question:
   
   1. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

 ## Task 2 : Prediction Using Unsupervised ML

  In this task we will use the Iris [dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) and try to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

## Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
In this task, we will use the iris dataset and create a Decision Tree Classifier to classify the different iris flower species using the Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length and Petal width as a feature.

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
